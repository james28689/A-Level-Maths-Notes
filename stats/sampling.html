        <h2>Types of Data</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Data can be divided into two main types: qualitative and quantitative.</li>
			<li>Qualitative data is non numerical, e.g: written opinions on the state of roads.</li>
			<li>Quantitative data is numerical, e.g: the number of different colour cars that pass a certain point.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Discrete, Continuous, and Categoric Data</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Quantitative data can be divided into 3 types:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Continuous data is data that is numerical in nature and can take an infinite number of values.</li>
				<li>Discrete data is data that can only take certain values, and and these values are countable.</li>
				<li>Categoric data is where the data is discrete but the variables are non-numeric.</li>
			</ol>
		</ul>
		<h2>Populations and Samples</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>A population is the entire set of objects from which we can draw a sample.</li>
			<li>A sample is a subset of the population. When a sample is the same size as its population, it becomes a census.</li>
			<li>The advantages of taking a census rather than a sample are:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>You get data about the characteristics of the entire population.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The disadvantages are:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Costly</li>
				<li>Time consuming</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Taking a sample mitigates these disadvantages provided the sample is <strong>representative of the population</strong>. A sample that does not represent its population is referred to as <strong>biased</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Sampling Techniques</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><h3>Simple Random Sampling</h3></li>
			<li>This method ensures that each member of the population has an equal chance of being chosen. A possible method for choosing such a sample is:</li>
			<li><h3>Stratified Sampling</h3></li>
			<li>This is a sampling technique in which every subcategory of the population is proportionally represented within the sample.</li>
			<li>Once the sizes of subcategories aer chosen for the sample, use simple random sampling on each subcategory.</li>
			<li><h3>Systematic Sampling</h3></li>
			<li>This involves coming up with a rule to apply to a population to generate your sample, e.g: choosing every 10th person from a list of the entire population.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>NOTE</b>: All of the above methods assume that any participants are willing. This is rarely the case, in such circumstances where willing participants are scarce, the following methods could be used.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><h3>Opportunity Sampling</h3></li>
			<li>Ask the first people you see until you have enough data.</li>
			<li><h3>Quota Sampling</h3></li>
			<li>Have an idea of how many of each subcategory of the population are to be surveyed (e.g: as in stratified) then use opportunity sampling to fill the quota.</li>
			<li><h3>Cluster Sampling</h3></li>
			<li>Choose a cluster of people from a population then ask them all.</li>
